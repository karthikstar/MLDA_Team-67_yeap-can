The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the way of life for billions of people around the world. COVID-19 pneumonia is a serious illness that can be deadly. Given the situation above, we felt it was apt to work on pneumonia detection which could help doctors to more accurately detect pneumonia from chest x-ray images. 

Thus, We will be training a model that is able to detect whethere there is pneumonia or not in Chest X-Ray images.

We will be doing transfer learning using a famous Imagenet Model known as InceptionV3. 

We managed to obtain a model accuracy of 93.94% based on our test dataset.
