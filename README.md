As COVID-19 becomes endemic, the strain on healthcare services worldwide intensifies, making it more difficult to manage & detect the serious complications of COVID-19

Our solution is to train a machine learning model with normal pneumonia x-ray datasets so that the model can be potentially used to detect cases of COVID-19 pneumonia 

We will be doing transfer learning using a pre-trained  Model known as InceptionV3. 

We managed to obtain a model accuracy of 93.94% based on our test dataset.
